# ICT1004-Project

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide students with practical experience applying the technologies and concepts learned in ICT1004. You will design and develop a fully functioning website that features a responsive UI, is mobile-friendly, works with all popular browsers, and adheres to modern design principles and standards.

## Organisation
Working in teams, you are to build the website for a fictitious company/organization of your choosing (do not use real entities). You are free to have fun and be creative in selecting the type of business and the products and/or services it provides, however your web application must satisfy all of the requirements below.

## General Requirements
A main landing page that introduces the company/organization.
* A common menu that allows the user to navigate to the various sub-pages.
* Sub-pages covering the products and/or services that the company provides.
* Sub-page that provides more details about the company/organization (e.g. “About Us”).
* Back-end functionality supporting the creation, storing and updating of data (e.g. user
membership, product catalogue, shopping cart, blog posts, etc.).

## Technical Requirements
* Responsive, device-independent, mobile friendly design utilizing HTML5, Bootstrap and CSS.
* JavaScript should be used for event handling and any other client-side logic.
* PHP and MySQL should be utilized to implement all back-end functionality.
* Comprehensive database operations (CRUD) are implemented.
* Proper form validation and sanitization.
* Website should be secure from cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks.
* Passwords and personally identifiable information should be protected.
* W3C Web Validation and WCAG standards are adhered to.

## Optional Features
Beyond the minimum requirements, your team is free to implement whatever additional features you wish. This may include search engine optimization (SEO), asynchronous operations (AJAX), enhanced security, etc.

## Submission Deadline
Each group must submit one copy of their project to xSiTe NO LATER THAN Friday, 4 December 2020. Refer to the submission instructions below.

## Submission Instructions
* Each group will be required to publish their website to a LAMP server running on AWS (within the ICT1004 AWS Educate Classroom). This server must remain available for at least two weeks after the submission deadline, in order to give your Supervisor time to assess the website.
* In addition to hosting your site on the web server, you are also required to submit a zipped copy of your project to xSiTe. Only one submission per group is required - do not submit individual versions of your work. Only the latest submission will be graded.
* Please take careful note of the submission deadlines above - late submissions will not be accepted.
Presentation
Teams will be required to give a short demonstration of their website. Each team member will have equal time to present and should detail their individual contributions to the project. Presentation schedules will be released separately.

## Report
Each group is also required to submit a report documenting their work. The report is due at the same time as the final project submission and should be uploaded to xSiTe along with the .zip file containing your project. Requirements for the report are as follows:
* The report should generally be around 8-12 pages, not including cover page, table of contents, references and appendix sections. This is only a guideline – feel free to expand if justified.
* The cover page should include the names of the members in your group (full name and matriculation number), the module code, your group number, and the title of your project.
* The report should describe the design and implementation of the system. Include details of the tools and methodologies used by the team.
* Each team member should list in point form the contributions they have made to the project and the percentage of completion for each contribution.
* Soft copy of the report in Word or PDF format should be uploaded to xSiTe along with the final project.

## Peer Evaluation
Group members shall conduct peer reviews at the end of the project using the TEAMMATES application. Instructions for the peer eval will be released separately.
